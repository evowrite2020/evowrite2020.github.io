<h3>Info</h3>
<p>This is the workshop website for the session "The evolution of writing systems" at the <a href="https://www.zfs.uni-hamburg.de/dgfs2020/dgfs2020.html" target="_blank">42<sup>nd</sup> International Conference of the German Linguistics Society (DGfS)</a>.</p>


<h3>Call for Papers</h3>
<p>Recent years have seen an increased interest in the investigation of graphemic systems both from a linguistic point of view and in a decidedly interdisciplinary perspective  (e.g. Morin et al. 2018, Condorelli & Rutkowska in prep.). In particular, various projects have set out to investigate how graphic codes emerge, how they change over time, and to what degree the diachronic development of writing systems can give clues to the cognitive principles underlying language. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers who investigate the emergence and diachronic change of graphemic systems using corpus-based and/or experimental approaches. Apart from empirical studies investigating the writing system of one specific language, we particularly welcome contributions taking a cross-linguistic perspective by comparing the dynamics of spelling principles and the evolution of graphemic codes in different languages and/or across different scripts. Questions to be discussed include – but are not limited to – the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(How) does the emergence and/or standardization of written language influence the development of natural language?</li>
	<li>Can we detect cross-linguistically widespread principles of graphemic change? – For instance, the development of sentence-internal capitalization seems to follow similar patterns across different languages, although it only prevails in German.</li>
	<li>How do different (partly conflicting) spelling principles interact in writing systems, and how does the division of labor between these principles change over time?</li>
	<li>Which factors (e.g. grammatical, cultural, socio-pragmatic) influence the development of writing systems?</li>
</ul>


<p>We invite abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations (~20 minutes presentation time + discussion) relevant to the theme session. Depending on the number of submissions, we might be able to offer one-hour timeslots: If you are interested in a long presentation, please let us know in the abstract or in the email. Abstracts should clearly state the research question(s), the methodological approach, and the (expected) results, and they should not be much longer than 500 words. Please send your abstracts to <b>stefan1.hartmann[at]uni-bamberg.de and nowakj[at]uni-mainz.de</b> by <b>August 15, 2019</b>. Notifications of acceptance/rejection can be expected in early September.</p>



<h3>Travel grants</h3>

<p>Please note that neither we nor the DGfS can cover travel expenses for workshop participants. However, <b>a limited number of travel grants</b> of up to 500 Euros each are available for accepted contributions by DGfS members without income or with low income.</p>
